# CLAUDE.md

Guidance for Claude Code (and future me) when working in this repo.

## What this is

A chess puzzle training web app — solve tactics puzzles, rating adapts to
performance (Glicko-2), eventually personalized via an ML layer trained on
solving behavior, eventually pulling candidate puzzles from a user's own
chess.com game history.

Secondary but real motivation: this is a portfolio piece for a Chess.com
"All-Stack Engineer" application (Connect team — they build friends lists,
follower graphs, top-player rankings, and puzzle-path ranking / comparing
performance against friends). That's why the stack choices below aren't
arbitrary, and why "puzzle rating + friends leaderboard" is the priority
feature slice, not the full original vision.

## Current state

Working name: **Blindspot**. All three top-level services now exist in this
monorepo: `frontend/`, `backend/`, and `ml/` (Python) — see the design doc's
Architecture section for why one repo, not three.

## Stack

**Frontend (`frontend/`):**
- Vue 3 + TypeScript + Vite
- Board UI: `vue3-chessboard` (wraps Lichess's `chessground` + `chess.js`
  internally — don't add a direct `chess.js` dependency, it's already pulled
  in transitively)
- `vue-router` for `/` (puzzle solving) and `/history` (attempt history)
- No component library beyond that; styling is hand-written CSS, chess-themed
  palette (walnut/charcoal background `#1c1a17`, parchment text `#ede6d6`,
  brass accent `#b8985a`) — intentionally not generic SaaS-dashboard styling

**Backend (`backend/`):**
- Symfony (PHP), chosen over Spring Boot deliberately — see "Why Symfony"
- MySQL in production; SQLite is fine for local dev, same Doctrine schema
- Custom stateless API-token authenticator (`Authorization: Bearer <token>`),
  not JWT — avoids needing a JWT bundle + keypair for what's still a demo.
  Tokens live in their own `ApiToken` table (not a column on `User`), so a
  user can hold multiple valid tokens (multi-device) with independent expiry
- Entities: `User`, `Puzzle`, `ApiToken`, `PuzzleAttempt`. `PuzzleAttempt`
  currently records one row per puzzle load (first mistake or the solve,
  whichever comes first) — `success`, `timeSpentSeconds`, and a FK to
  `Puzzle` (rating is read via join, never duplicated onto the attempt row).
  Expected to grow additional per-attempt features over time as the ML side
  needs more signal — don't hardcode assumptions about this field set being
  final. `User` also carries `rating`/`ratingDeviation`/`volatility`/
  `ratingUpdatedAt` (Glicko-2 state). `Friendship` is built: mutual,
  single row per pair (`requester`/`addressee`/`status`), matching the
  "friends list" framing rather than a directed follow graph — see
  `FriendshipController` and `Friendship`'s class doc for the invariants
  (no duplicate reverse row; a same-direction re-request flips an existing
  reverse-pending row to accepted instead of erroring).
- `GlickoRatingService` and `PuzzleSelectionService`: **built**.
  - `GlickoRatingService`: full Glicko-2 port, validated against Glickman's
    own published worked example (rating 1500/RD 200/vol 0.06 vs three
    opponents → ~1464.06 / 151.52 / 0.05999 — see
    `backend/tests/Service/GlickoRatingServiceTest.php`). Runs after every
    puzzle attempt, treating each attempt as a one-game rating period
    against the puzzle's own rating, and writes the result onto `User`
  - `PuzzleSelectionService`: rating-band heuristic — picks from a band
    around the player's Glicko rating, sized by their rating deviation.
    Deliberately the only place that decides "next puzzle" — the swap-in
    point for `ml/`'s recommendations later; don't scatter puzzle-picking
    logic into controllers. An explicit `?mode=random` query param, or an
    anonymous request (no rating to match against), falls back to the
    original uniform-random behavior
    (`PuzzleRepository::findOneRandom()`), which still exists for that path
- Puzzle data: Lichess's open CC0 puzzle database is the real source
  (https://database.lichess.org/#puzzles), imported via
  `bin/console app:import-puzzles` — **run with `APP_DEBUG=0`** for
  anything beyond a few thousand rows, Doctrine's dev-mode query/backtrace
  logger grows unbounded and will OOM well before finishing a full import.
  6.1M rows imported locally. A handful of hand-built, python-chess-verified
  puzzles also exist in the frontend (`frontend/src/puzzles.ts`) as an
  offline fallback shown when the backend is unreachable — those aren't
  backend-tracked and never recorded to attempt history
- `Puzzle.rating` has a DB index (`idx_puzzle_rating`) — at 6.1M rows, both
  rating-band selection and the ml/ theme-bias path filter on it, and it was
  a 3s+ full table scan without one. `Puzzle.themes` (and `.solution`) are
  `array`-typed properties that Doctrine maps to `Types::JSON`, i.e. stored
  as real JSON text (not PHP's serialize format) — this is what makes them
  readable by `ml/` without an export step
- `MlRecommendationClient`: the only thing in `backend/` that knows `ml/`
  exists. Calls `ml/`'s recommendation endpoint with a short timeout
  (500ms) and swallows every failure mode into an empty theme list — `ml/`
  being down or slow must never break a puzzle load. Use `127.0.0.1`, not
  `localhost`, for `ML_SERVICE_URL`: on Windows, curl's IPv6-then-IPv4
  fallback for "localhost" adds several seconds even when nothing's
  listening, which defeats the timeout
- `PuzzleRepository::findOneNearRatingWithThemes()`: there's no indexable
  "JSON array contains" check available here, and at this row count a
  `LIKE '%"theme"%'` scan across a whole rating band (hundreds of thousands
  of rows) measured 3-10s. It instead pulls a bounded random sample
  (200 rows) from the indexed rating-band range and filters for a theme
  match in PHP — fast, and correct as long as the band has reasonable theme
  density, which in practice it does

**ML/personalization (`ml/`):**
- Python (FastAPI + SQLAlchemy + Alembic, `uv`-managed). Deliberately a
  separate deployable service from `backend/` (not in-process PHP) — ML
  tooling is overwhelmingly Python-ecosystem, and this is the part of the
  product meant to grow well past simple heuristics
- Reads `Puzzle`/`PuzzleAttempt`/`User` directly from the same database
  `backend/` writes to (no export/ETL pipeline) — via plain SQLAlchemy Core
  `Table` objects in `ml/src/ml/db.py`, kept in a separate `MetaData` from
  ml/'s own tables so Alembic never touches Doctrine-owned schema (and vice
  versa: `PuzzleRepository` never queries `user_pattern_weakness`). Owns one
  derived table, `user_pattern_weakness` (per-user, per-theme miss rate),
  migrated with Alembic (`uv run alembic upgrade head` from `ml/`) — this is
  a real, separate migration history from `backend/migrations/`, on purpose
- The frontend never talks to `ml/` directly — only `backend/` does,
  server-to-server via `MlRecommendationClient`; `backend/` stays the single
  public-facing API
- Phase 1 (built): weak-pattern targeting. `GET /users/{id}/recommendation`
  mines that user's `PuzzleAttempt` history, grouped by `Puzzle.themes` tag,
  comparing observed miss rate against an Elo-style expected miss rate from
  their current rating (`ml/src/ml/weakness.py`) — themes missed
  disproportionately (min sample size 5, configurable via `MIN_SAMPLE_SIZE`)
  come back as `biasedThemes`, worst-first. `PuzzleSelectionService` tries a
  themed rating-band pick first, falling back to the plain rating-band pick
  on an empty list or no in-band match
- Phase 2/3 (further out): generating candidate puzzles from a player's own
  chess.com games, then generating positions from scratch when neither the
  puzzle database nor their games have enough natural examples of a
  detected weakness

## Why Symfony (not Spring Boot)

Both are in the target job posting's stack. Symfony/PHP is the deeper,
longer-running stack there (shows up in that company's job postings years
apart); Spring Boot is newer/still being adopted internally. Symfony was the
deliberate choice for depth over breadth. If this changes, update this file.

## Known constraints

- **GPL-3.0**: `chessground` (via `vue3-chessboard`) is GPL-3.0-licensed. Any
  combined work must ship under a GPL-compatible license. Fine for a public
  portfolio repo; would block ever going closed-source without replacing it.
- **Windows + Git Bash** is the dev environment. Prefer commands that work
  there; flag anything that specifically needs WSL or PowerShell.

## Open items / unverified

(none currently — the `check`-after-`move` event ordering in
`ChessBoard.vue` was verified in the browser against a real puzzle and
behaves as assumed.)

## Commands

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev      # Vite dev server, http://localhost:5173

cd backend
php -S localhost:8000 -t public   # http://localhost:8000 — frontend's
                                   # VITE_API_BASE_URL points here by default

cd ml
uv run uvicorn ml.main:app --port 8001   # backend's ML_SERVICE_URL points here
uv run alembic upgrade head               # apply ml/'s own migrations
uv run pytest
```

Both `frontend/` and `backend/` have their own `public/` — a common mistake
is running the backend's PHP server with `-t public` from the wrong working
directory (check `ls public/index.php` first if `/api/...` routes 404 with
"No such file or directory").

`ml/` is optional for local dev — `backend/` degrades gracefully (plain
rating-band selection) if it's not running, so you don't need it up just to
solve puzzles. Start it when working on weak-pattern targeting specifically.

## Working style

I'm learning Vue/TypeScript hands-on and want to understand what's
happening, not just get working code — explain non-obvious choices inline
(comments or chat) rather than silently picking a fancier pattern over a
simpler one I'd understand. As of 2026-09-03 I'd rather you just make the
edits directly (frontend included) than have me drive them myself — the
explain-as-you-go part still stands, just not the "let me type it" part.
